# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome to my simple static site! I'm excited to share this project with you and show how you can build a beautiful, functional website without complex frameworks or build tools.

## What Makes This Site Special?

This website is built with just the fundamentals:

- **HTML5** for semantic structure
- **CSS3** with modern features like Grid and Flexbox

No webpack, no React, no complex build processes - just clean, efficient code that works everywhere.

All without the complexity of modern build tools.
